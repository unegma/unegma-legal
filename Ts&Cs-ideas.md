Change Orders: Given that scope changes might be frequent in web development projects, it's helpful to define a process for how changes to the agreed-upon scope are requested, approved, priced, and implemented.

Acceptance Criteria: Detail the specific criteria or benchmarks that need to be met for the delivered work to be considered acceptable by the Client. This can help avoid misunderstandings regarding the expected quality or features of the delivered project.

Support & Maintenance: While you mentioned that maintenance would be under a separate agreement, you might want to specify if there's a brief warranty period post-delivery where the Service Provider will fix any bugs or issues free of charge.

Force Majeure: This clause provides that neither party will be responsible for delays or failure to meet their obligations due to causes outside their reasonable control, such as natural disasters, strikes, or civil disturbances.

Default and Remedies: Define what constitutes a default on the agreement (e.g., non-payment, failure to deliver services) and what remedies are available to the non-defaulting party.

Assignment: Specify whether parties have the right to assign their obligations or benefits under the contract to a third party.

Indemnification: This protects either party from liabilities, losses, damages, or expenses caused by the other party's actions or breaches of the agreement.

Relationship of Parties: A clause clarifying that the Service Provider is an independent contractor and not an employee can be crucial for tax and legal responsibilities.

Waiver: A statement noting that if either party waives any breach of the agreement, it doesn't mean they waive future breaches of the same or other provisions.

Entire Agreement: A clause indicating that the contract represents the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings, and agreements. This ensures that any promises made outside of this written agreement are not enforceable.

Amendments: Specify that any changes to the agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.

Notices: Outline the process and address for delivering formal notices related to the agreement.
