## Third Parties
The Provider may engage third-party services for specialised tasks. The Client may have third parties with which the Provider will need to engage.

If the Client wishes for the Provider to speak with one of their Third Party providers, it is the responsibility of the Client to decide whether the Provider will need to act as an Undisclosed Agent, and the Client must make provisions for this case.

## Purpose

## Intellectual Property

* Generic and Sideground IP: We reserve the right to reuse Generic IP between projects. IP generated by a third party specialist will fall into the category of Generic IP.
* Third Party Software libraries and systems will likely be used within the Project, the Client will be informed of any known payments one off or ongoing required for these.

The Provider is not a qualified legal or financial body and, whilst we endeavour to keep up with relevant changes in these areas, any advice given by Unegma LTD does not constitute professional financial or legal advice, as would usually be obtained by an accredited professional.

## Non Compete
Unless a prior relationship with a Third Party of the Client was previously in place, the Provider will not seek new contracts with any of the Client's third party providers without explicit approval during the course of the Project, and for a pre-agreed period of time after.

## Development Lifecycle

### Scope of Services
The Provider specialises in web development and primarily deals with text-based code. Design assets should be provided by the Client or can be created at an additional cost. The scope of work is as agreed upon in prior correspondences and can be amended upon mutual agreement.

Roles such as Project Management and Product Ownership, often falling within Agile workflows, will be carried out and managed by the Client. The Provider is happy to help with scoping out and designing business logic, but this responsibility will primarily fall on the Client.

Before the commencement of the Project, a comprehensive scope will be defined and documented. This scope will serve as a reference and guideline throughout the Project's lifecycle. The original scope may comprise a visual design, but as the project develops, ticketing will be expected.

As the Project develops, certain features may be determined to have a larger scope than originally anticipated. In this scenario, these features will become part of a separate scope of work which will require the development of separate business logic.

The scope will outline the project's objectives, deliverables, timelines, and other essential parameters. Any modifications or extensions to the scope post-agreement will require mutual consent and may lead to adjustments in timelines and/or costs.

### Development Process
The Provider will begin the Project by first creating Core Functionality with minimal Design Code. We focus first on Core Functionality as we believe fundamentally that a working System delivers more value than one which looks nice but doesn't do anything.

### Refactoring
We prefer to work quickly at the start of a Project to develop Core Functionality and further assess the Scope of the Project at the initial stages. The Project will then gather Technical Debt and code will require time to be cleaned up. The Client will be informed when this happens.

There will be a working demo by this point, and a refactor won't change much obvious funcionality. After this initial clean up and optimisation, we will usually suggest bringing in tighter Project Management so that granular aspects of the Code can be developed more efficiently.

### Testing and Demoing
During the development phase, gathering feedback is paramount for refining and enhancing the product. With this in mind, the Provider may occasionally present the product to a select group of trusted third parties as part of the demonstration process. This "show and tell" mechanism is designed to identify potential challenges, gather diverse insights, and test the product's intuitiveness and overall user experience in a real-world setting.

### Sign off
It is the responsibility of the Client's to audit/test any code before use in production, especially when dealing with code handling finance/digital assets. The Provider will aim to work with The Client as closely as possible, often through a number of example scenarios, until the Client is happy that the work is in the best agreed working state. 

The Client will be aware that code often needs to be maintained in order to keep up with security updates, or breaking changes due to third parties. The Provider will not be liable for any data breaches as a result of the Project not being actively maintained. Any ongoing maintenance by the Provider will require the negotiation of a separately scoped out agreement.

## Data Protection & Security
The Provider will employ best practices for data protection. The Provider cannot guarantee absolute data security, but frequently uses a third party provider for testing the security of The System. System logs will be kept for a maximum of 2 weeks.

The Provider will not be held liable for any compromise or loss of data in the event that a Client's third party system, with whom we are contracted to work, does not meet adequate security requirements.

Any of the Client's data stored on the Provider's systems is encrypted and uses strong passwords. The Provider uses 2FA extensively where possible.

We will not hold any personal details of users so as to comply with GDPR requirements, this will be the responsibility of the Client or GDPR approved Third Party.

## Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure
Both parties acknowledge that during the course of this Agreement, each may obtain confidential information regarding the other's business. Such confidential information shall include, but not be limited to, trade secrets and business plans. Both parties agree not to disclose any confidential information obtained from the other, either directly or indirectly, to any third party. This section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

## Warranties
The Provider warrants that the services provided under this Agreement will be delivered with reasonable skill, care, and professionalism, and will be functionally operative, free of critical errors, and in conformity with relevant industry standards.

## Liabilities
In no event shall the Provider be liable to the Client or any third party for any consequential, indirect, special, incidental, or punitive damages. The liabilities of the Provider arising out of this Agreement, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed the amount paid by the Client under this Agreement.

## Dispute Resolution
Should any dispute arise with respect to this Agreement, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve such dispute through direct and good faith negotiations.

## Payment Terms
Invoices are payable within 30 days or as agreed otherwise. Interest may be charged on overdue payments at a rate of 8% p.a. above the base rate of the Bank of England. A non-refundable deposit of 20% is required upfront for fixed-term projects.

## Termination
Any deviations from the agreed scope may require renegotiation or termination of this Agreement. The Provider requires payment for all work done up to the point of termination.
