# Terms and Conditions

## Parties

* Us/We/Our - Unegma
* You - the Client

## IP rights

As far as possible, in all jurisdictions, the work we do for you is yours, and regarding this work we waive any future IP rights (grant a perpetual usage license in the UK). We do however request permission to add you to our website as a partner, and to use your company logo as part of our promotional material unless otherwise agreed. 

In the case of software, we will usually use third party libraries (as is accepted practice in software development) and sometimes use our own libraries within projects: these contain code which could be used within any other project without exposing any client's unique business logic or data. See [our Github](https://github.com/unegma/) for more info.

## Advisory and Project Management

We are aware that each company has its own structure and way of working; if you do not have a Project Management system in place, we will suggest our own tools and methodologies (following Agile principles as best as possible). 

Unegma LTD is not a qualified legal or financial body and, whilst we endeavour to keep up with relevant changes in these areas, any advice given by Unegma LTD does not constitute professional financial or legal advice, as would usually be obtained by an accredited professional.

## Third Party Providers

We will sometimes use trusted third party providers to complete supplementary work which falls within the scope of our responsibilities. Any delegated work will be done in such a way as to protect the identity and the business aims and objectives of the Client.

## Non Compete

Sometimes you may need us to work with your trusted third party providers. We will not seek out our own contracts with your third party providers without your explicit approval whilst we are working for you, and for a pre-agreed period of time after (unless a prior relationship with the third party was in place).

## Invoices

If invoices are unable to be paid on time, please speak to us and we will seek to come to some arrangement with you. In the event of no agreed arrangement, Unegma LTD will reduce it's time working with the Client (no matter the deadline of the project), until there has been a new arrangement. We don't usually do retainers, but we do ask for at least weekly billing.

## Security, Backups and Data

We aim to keep relevant data backed up, on your servers if possible. We prefer not to use any of our own servers to keep data, as this makes a 'handover' difficult, and could also put us in a vulnerable position should there be a data breach. 

To best protect any clients' data that does happen to be on our own devices, we ensure that our hard disks use encryption, and that we use strong passwords. We also use 2FA extensively where possible.

We will not be held liable for any compromise of data in the event that a client's third party system, which we are contracted to work with, does not meet adequate security requirements. 

We can offer some security advice to clients (via a trusted third party provider), and we will strongly advise following up on this in the case that a client is working with highly sensitive data.

## Brand Visibility and Reputation

We have a reputation to maintain, we know that you do too, therefore we will collaborate with you to the very best of our ability in order to provide you with a professional product and service. We are also happy to work for you as an [Undisclosed Agent](https://www.google.com?q=undisclosed+agent) when working with third parties (you will provide an email account for usage). 

## Quality Assurance / Audit / Sign Off

It is the responsiblity of the Client's team to audit/test any code before use in production, especially when dealing with code handling finance/digital assets. If your team does not have the capacity for extensive audits, we will aim to work with you as closely as possible, often through a number of example scenarios, until the Client is happy that the work is in the best agreed working state. Please be aware that code often needs to be maintained in order to keep up with security updates, or breaking changes due to third parties.

## Revisions and Liabilities

If something goes wrong, we will work with you as closely and quickly as possible to rectify/mitigate any unintended scenarios. Unegma LTD will not be responsible for any loss of data or reputation as a result of a decision that was made counter to reasonable advice. 

We update this document from time to time, we will let you know when we do; usually in the footer of regular corresponsence (emails), because we probably hate spam just as much as you do.
